Social Restaurant Finding Android App

__Contributors__: Jorge Torres-Aldana  
__Language(s)__: Android Java  
__Libraries__: ButterKnife, Google Places API, Google Maps API

__Description__: This application allows users to select a radius, and then shows up to 20 restaurants in the vicinity. These restaurants are gathered using Google Places API. The user can then select to show the relative location of the eestaurant and can then route to the restaurant and invite others via the sms application of their choosing.

__Notes__: As is, the application will not work. It requires valid Google Places and Google Maps API keys. These, along with their location files, have been removed for security reasons. Below can be found examples of what the application looks like.

__Future Features__: 
* Add filters to the restaurant list screen.
* Add more than 20 restaurants to search.
* Add internal restaurant route functionality.
